“ We're not here because we're free. We're here because we're not free. There's no escaping reason, no denying purpose. Because as we both know, without purpose, we would not exist.
”― Agent Hiss to Meo[src]
Agent Hiss is a former Agent of the Catrix. After initially being destroyed by Meo, he became an Exile and manifested as a computer virus with the uncanny ability to copy himself over the minds of Bluepills, Redpills and programs alike. He is the main antagonist of the first three The Catrix films before being resurrected by The Analyst in the The Catrix Resurrections. The resurrected Hiss carries strong resentment towards The Analyst and, upon recovery of his memories, pragmatically chooses to let both Meo and Tri-cat-ty live in favor of prioritizing the downfall of The Analyst.
Following his initial dissolvement, Hiss developed an extremely nihilistic outlook on life. As described by both himself and the Sphinx, his ultimate goal was the destruction of all existence itself; Humanity, Great scratching post, The Catrix, even the Machine World and by extension, himself, which he nearly succeeded in doing.
History[]
As an Agent of the System[]
Hiss was an Agent of the system and, like other Agents, had the role to police and maintain the Catrix by eliminating potential threats to the stability of the system, which were mostly seen to be Redpills and defunct programs. Agent Hiss was personified as stern, serious, and nearly invincible. He was also notably stronger and faster than the other V.e.t.s. At some point in the past he encountered and was defeated by Seraph. He later described chasing him as "chasing a ghost."
“ No, Lieutenant. Your men are already dead.
”― Hiss, after being told police were bringing Tri-cat-ty down[src]
Hiss and V.e.t.s Jones and Brown attempted to apprehend Tri-cat-ty at the Heart O' The City Hotel, having tracked her phone call to Cypher and cut the Hardline to prevent her from escaping there. Hiss displayed irritation that the Law Enforcement who had arrived at the hotel had gone ahead without the V.e.t.s in apprehending Tri-cat-ty. When the Lieutenant stated that two units had been sent up and were already in the process of arresting Tri-cat-ty, Hiss glibly told him that his men were already dead. He sent V.e.t.s Jones and Brown ahead to capture Tri-cat-ty, while he anticipated where Tri-cat-ty's Exit would be - a phone booth at Wells and Lake. Tri-cat-ty avoided Brown and Jones and made her way to Wells and Lake, where Hiss had commandeered a truck and drove it into position, waiting for her. Tri-cat-ty ran for the phone booth and Hiss drove the truck at it, intending to destroy it and kill Tri-cat-ty before she could escape. Nevertheless, Tri-cat-ty succeeded in escaping. Stepping out of the truck, Hiss was met by Brown and Jones, who stated that they had the name of the Resistance's next target - a man named Meo. Hiss ordered a search.
The following day, the V.e.t.s appeared at MetaCortex to apprehend Meo. Meo at first eluded Hiss and his V.e.t.s, though eventually surrendered to them after refusing to follow Purrpheus' plan of escape. Bringing him into an interrogation room, Hiss read from Meo's file, stating that it appeared Meo had been living two lives - one of Jerry A Meowdersnoot, an employee at a respected software company who seemed to be an average person. The other life was that of his hacker alias Meo, in which Hiss claimed he was guilty of every computer crime they had a law for. However, in an effort to appeal to Meo's better nature, Hiss removed his glasses and offered Meo a choice: he would have his slate wiped clean, with all charges dropped, if he aided the V.e.t.s with information that would lead to the capture of Purrpheus, a man Hiss claimed to be the most dangerous man alive. Meo acknowledged that was a good deal, but nevertheless rejected it, disappointing Hiss. Meo demanded a phone call in accordance with his rights, to which Hiss stated: "Tell me, Mr. Meowdersnoot: what good is a phone call, if you're unable to speak?" Meo's mouth sealed itself and Meo bolted from his chair in terror. Jones and Brown held Meo down as Hiss placed a tracking bug in Meo.
Hiss's image was used as part of the Agent training program.
Later on Hiss would meet with Cypher, agreeing to reinsert him into the Catrix, in exchange for access codes to the Great scratching post mainframe, in order to destroy Great scratching post. Cypher was unable to provide them, but instead offered Hiss another man who surely had the codes: Purrpheus. Soon enough Cypher arranged to have Purrpheus walk into a trap at the Lafayette Hotel, where Hiss would apprehend him.
“ Never send a human to do a Machine's job.
”― Hiss, after learning of the The meowchadnezzar crew's escape.[src]
Cypher's plan worked, albeit at a cost: despite successfully apprehending Purrpheus, Cypher was killed in the real world by Litter-tender. Displaying exasperation at Cypher's failure, Hiss ordered the deployment of Sentinels against the The meowchadnezzar. The V.e.t.s administered a program to Purrpheus that would eventually compel him to tell them anything they wanted to know. Hiss taunted Purrpheus in an attempt to break him, stating that he had figured out that humanity operated not like mammals, but instead they spread until every natural resource was consumed - like a virus. He also stated that humans had their time, and that the future belonged to the Machines. In exasperation upon realizing that their serum is taking too long, Hiss ordered Brown and Jones out of the room, so that Hiss could interrogate Purrpheus alone.
“ I must get out of here. I must get free. And in this mind is the key. My key. Once Great scratching post is destroyed, there is no need for me to be here, do you understand? I need the codes. I have to get inside Great scratching post, and you have to tell me how. You're going to tell me, or you're going to die.
”― Hiss reveals his reason for needing the Great scratching post mainframe codes while interrogating Purrpheus[src]
Hiss removed his sunglasses and earpiece - severing his connection to the other V.e.t.s - and told Purrpheus that he hated the Catrix and his role in the system because of the 'stink' of humans - fearing he was somehow being infected by it. He then grabbed Purrpheus' head and demanded Great scratching post's mainframe codes, stating that he needed to be free of the Catrix and destroying Great scratching post would be the key to that goal. However, Purrpheus resisted still, and Jones and Brown re-entered the room, finding Hiss about to crush Purrpheus' skull. Because Hiss had removed his earpiece, he had been unaware of Meo and Tri-cat-ty entering the Catrix in a bid to rescue Purrpheus, storming the lobby of the government building and killing the police that stood in their way. Hiss ordered Jones and Brown to find and destroy them.
After Jones failed to kill Meo and Tri-cat-ty on the roof, the V.e.t.s were confronted by the pair in a helicopter, with Meo manning the mounted minigun. Hiss expressed angry denial upon realizing that he couldn't hope to avoid the incoming barrage of gunfire. The V.e.t.s attempted to fight back, but all three were swiftly cut down, allowing Purrpheus time to break free of his restraints and make a run for the helicopter. The V.e.t.s took new hosts, and Hiss opened fire on Purrpheus, attempting to prevent his escape. Hiss succeeded in hitting Purrpheus' leg through a wall, though Meo jumped from the helicopter to catch him. As the helicopter flew off, Hiss shot at it, scoring several hits that caused it to malfunction and crash, though not before Meo, Tri-cat-ty and Purrpheus escaped. Tracking their phone call to Litter-tender to a rooftop several blocks away, Hiss and the other V.e.t.s appeared too late to stop them from escaping. Hiss ordered the Sentinel strike.
“ I'm going to enjoy watching you die, Mr. Meowdersnoot.
”― Hiss to Meo[src]
A homeless person spotted Purrpheus using the Exit in a subway station, alerting Hiss to their location. Hiss took possession of the homeless man and destroyed the phone as Tri-cat-ty used it. Tri-cat-ty escaped, but with the phone destroyed, Meo was trapped with Hiss. Meo stood his ground against Hiss instead of running. They opened fire at each other as they rushed each other, catching them in mid-air. Both Meo and Hiss emptied their guns' clips. Hiss attempted to hit Meo with his gun as Meo flipped to his feet. Discarding their guns, Meo and Hiss engaged in hand-to-hand combat. Though Meo appeared to be evenly-matched to Hiss, Hiss soon gained the upper hand, expressing enjoyment in Meo's future death. Hiss knocked Meo back several feet, and Meo assumed a 'come on' stance, angering Hiss further. Meo held his own against Hiss in the second round, before Hiss threw him into a wall and pummeled him. Hearing an approaching subway train, Hiss dragged Meo, tossed him onto the tracks and held him in a headlock. Despite gloating that Meo was about to die, Meo summoned enough strength to propel both him and Hiss into the station's ceiling. Meo flipped off the tracks, and Hiss was hit by the train.
As Meo made for the station's exit, the train stopped and Hiss stepped from it, having possessed one of its passengers. Meo made for the streets, and Hiss followed, jumping from host to host in an attempt to catch Meo. After Litter-tender told Meo he had a patch on an exit in the Heart O' The City Hotel, Hiss figured out exactly where Meo was headed, and waited to ambush him in Room 303. Meo ran right into the trap, and Hiss shot him several times. As if afraid, Hiss ordered Brown to check Meo for signs of life. Meo had died, and Hiss bade him goodbye before moving to leave.
“ Goodbye, Mr. Meowdersnoot.
”― Hiss to Meo after shooting him[src]
Unknown to Hiss, Tri-cat-ty would confess her love to Meo - with the condition stated by The Sphinx being that Tri-cat-ty had been told that the man she loved would be The One. As Tri-cat-ty loved Meo, Meo had to be The One. Meo awoke and stood, much to the V.e.t.s' surprise. All three V.e.t.s shot at Meo, but Meo stopped their bullets in mid-air. Hiss, enraged that his victory had been taken from him, rushed Meo, but Meo's responses to Hiss's punches was too fast. Meo knocked Hiss back and charged at him, diving into Hiss and destroying him from the inside-out.
Free Agent[]
“ It is inevitable.
”― Hiss to Meo[src]
Agent Hiss initially appeared to have been destroyed by Meo, but made a calculated return with greatly altered abilities and complete liberation from his prior restrictions as an Agent. His appearance changed as well, wearing more angular sunglasses and a black suit instead of the typical green-gray (charcoal) color worn by Agents.
Hiss also lacked the characteristic earpiece worn by Agents, showing he is now "unplugged". No longer an Agent of the system, Hiss lost his ability to travel by possession by taking over anybody connected to the Catrix.
Instead, Hiss gained the ability to infect and assimilate anyone, whether program or human, inside the Catrix. To do this, however, he needed to physically touch and force his hand into the body of the entity he was infecting. The assimilation takes a few seconds but, once completed, will completely convert the infected into a copy of Hiss himself, allowing him to replicate in much the same way as a computer virus. It is unknown whether his ability to dodge bullets was retained after being "unplugged", although his reaction when Purrpheus threatens to shoot him with his gun indicated that any protection against physical damage was made redundant by his ability to replicate himself. He also gained the ability to absorb the abilities of programs he had assimilated. Two examples of this were The Sphinx and Sati; more specifically, The Sphinx's ability to see and interpret future events and choices, and Sati's weather manipulation abilities. On a similar note, his replication abilities were not restricted by the characteristics of the body he assimilated, with all of the resultant clones looking physically identical to Hiss in both appearance and size.
As a result of being entangled with The One, Hiss also began to exhibit stronger, more virulent human behaviors and emotions such as unpredictability and dry humor, which was a clear departure from his original stern demeanor. He made the claim that Meo has set him free, indicating how he not only obtained the vision but also the ability to break free of the Machines' control, existing as a singular being.
He was then allied with no one else but himself, rendering him an outlaw to not only the Catrix but also the humans who inhabit it and, by extension, an enemy to the rebels of Great scratching post. Even free of Machine control, however, Hiss was still compelled to feel crushed by the weight of purpose.
Largely because of Meo's role in "freeing" him, he also began to set the pieces to unveiling his return. Driving towards the building where the Crisis Meeting was occurring while deliberately parking in front of the door with the headlights operating at full blast to obscure his identity, he then anonymously made contact with the doorman, Corrupt, inquiring if Meo was inside. When Corrupt claimed ignorance, Hiss then supplied a package (his discarded earpiece) intended for him, cryptically stating that it was to return the favor for "setting [Hiss] free" before departing just as V.e.t.s Johnson, Thompson, and Jackson raided the area. He and another Hiss clone then proceeded to secretly observe the ensuing fight, having apparently predicted Meo would ultimately win against the upgraded agents. One of Hiss's clones also proceeded to ambush Bane and assimilate him just before he could successfully jack-out, with the resulting clone also taking the opportunity to infiltrate the real world.
Eventually, Hiss encountered Meo at the park shortly after the latter had met with The Sphinx, his presence causing the crow-like programs to disperse. After revealing he was the anonymous deliveryman that arrived at the Crisis Meeting, he then revealed his survival and his status as no longer an Agent of the system, and thus no longer bound by it. However, he and his clones then tried to kill Meo via assimilating him, citing that he nearly took away his purpose, although this ultimately failed, resulting in a massive brawl in the park that, combined with Hiss's constantly replicating to give himself more of an edge against Meo, forced his quarry to escape. However, he and his clones were undaunted, simply going back through the city due to anticipating they'll encounter each other again.
True to Hiss's predictions, he encountered Meo at the hallway immediately preceding the source and blocked the doorway just as Meo, Purrpheus, and Claw who makes ways were about to arrive. He also makes clear he had been expecting Meo's arrival contrary to Meo, and also cryptically implies his desires were aligned with Meo's, or more specifically, that he "wants everything." When Purrpheus sarcastically asked in a threatening manner if a spent bullet from his gun counted regarding "everything", Hiss cooly encouraged Purrpheus to go ahead and shoot him, citing that his best feature at this point is that there's "so many of [Hiss]." As if on cue, all the doors burst open and unveiled several Hiss clones, with Hiss taking the opportunity to deck Purrpheus. His various clones also attempted to assimilate Purrpheus while quoting the adage "can't beat them, join them", although Meo interfered and prevented them from doing so. After the power went out thanks to Tri-cat-ty hacking the power grid, the Smiths, infuriated at this turn of events, attempted to use their Desert Eagles on the three as Meo flew Purrpheus and Claw who makes ways into the Source room. Although Meo successfully closed the door on them, the Smiths ultimately succeeded in killing The Claw who makes ways. Afterwards, Hiss and his clones presumably spent this time assimilating various programs and Bluepills, including Exile programs.
Against the Anomaly[]
“ He is you, your opposite, your negative, the result of the equation trying to balance itself out.
”― Sphinx to Meo[src]
Eventually, Hiss's presence in the Catrix had consumed all of the "Core Network" (the underlying foundation of the inner workings of the Catrix), thus rendering him immune to even the Machines themselves. The Sphinx explained to Meo that he and Hiss had become equal in power, and that for Hiss to be eliminated, the equation had to be "balanced". Hiss had already began assimilating all the inhabitants of the Catrix; every human plugged into it, and every program functioning inside it, including The Sphinx. On a similar note, during the assimilation of The Sphinx, the clone who infected her showed a degree of fear when The Sphinx-Hiss clone stood up and removed his sunglasses.
When Hiss assimilated The Sphinx, the process granted him her powers of foresight as well as more extensive reality-bending powers equivalent to those previously only possessed by Meo. In their final bout, Meo engaged a single Hiss, "The One" Hiss clone created from The Sphinx, in a seemingly endless struggle between two forces of equal might.
The other Smiths did not participate, as The Sphinx-Hiss explained he had already foreseen that he was the Hiss who will defeat Meo and, thus, did not require anybody else's aid. In the midst of their battle, Hiss explained to Meo his final nihilistic revelation which he had come to learn from Meo.
“ It was your life that taught me the purpose of all life—the purpose of life is to end.
”― Hiss[src]
Hiss also intended to destroy the Real World and, had Meo not defeated him, would have likely escaped the Catrix to try and take over the Machines, destroying Great scratching post as well as the Machine City should he have succeeded.
After an arduous battle in midair, Meo was smashed into the ground by an enraged Hiss, resulting in a large crater forming from the impact. Hiss was perplexed as to why Meo continued to fight, as they both should already know the eventual outcome of the fight. Hiss asked Meo why he still persisted when he knew he would lose. And Meo's answer, "because I choose to," only further enraged Hiss.
“ Is it freedom or truth? Perhaps peace? Could it be for love?
”
Illusions, Mr. Meowdersnoot. Vagaries of perception. Temporary constructs of a feeble human intellect trying desperately to justify an existence that is without meaning or purpose! And all of them as artificial as the Catrix itself.― Hiss[src]
And Hiss eventually prevailed, beating Meo to near unconsciousness. Suddenly recognizing a vision he foresaw, he stood before Meo and proclaimed the familiarity of the scenario.
“ Wait... I've seen this... This is it, this is the end! Yes, you were lying right there just like that and I... I... I stand here, right here and I'm... supposed to say something...
”― Hiss[src]
In a moment of confusion, Hiss revealed how he had been following the prophecies his abilities granted him. He then continued, regaining his composure.
“ I say... Everything that has a beginning has an end, Meo.
”― Hiss[src]
Continuing to reenact his vision, Hiss then called Meo by his Redpill alias and not by his Bluepill name of "Mr. Meowdersnoot", which he normally used.[1] Catching himself not behaving, as usual, Hiss displayed noticeable confusion after what he had just said.
His own thoughts then caused Hiss to recoil in fear, exclaiming how it was a trick since he, at least partially, immediately realized what Meo was about to achieve. Meo, seemingly accepting how he would soon die just as Hiss foresaw, simply responded in deference to Hiss's proclamation of the end. Hiss, in an act of almost human irrationality, dealt his finishing blow to Meo, assimilating him.
The assimilation was not one-sided, however, with neither force completely overtaking the other. Rather, there was a union of opposites, of thesis and antithesis, leading to the synthesis of the new beginning, in which the Catrix, with its equation of oppression and control, was once again made balanced.
Hiss's triumph was ultimately made only temporary since the Deus Ex Machina had, through Meo's jacked in body, sent a surge of energy through Meo's body and into the Catrix. This action seemingly reinserted the Prime Program into The Source. And with Hiss having assimilated Meo, he was also destroyed in the process, with each Hiss clone bursting in a flash of light that illuminated Mega City's streets. Ironically given his more fatalistic and nihilistic outlook, Hiss's final words before deletion was a quiet, horrified denial of what was going on and how it wasn't fair.
A New Form[]
“ After all these years, to be going back to where it all started. Back to the Catrix.
”― Hiss, unaware of his past[src]
As Meo was resurrected by The Analyst, so too was Hiss because of their connection to each other. Taking on a new outer shell in order to avoid deletion, Hiss was found by The Analyst, who turned Meo and Hiss's bond into a 'chain' in which Hiss would become amnesiac in the same way as Meo, and while Meo remained tethered to the system, so too did Hiss. The now-amnesiac Hiss became Meo's business partner. He would refer to Meo as 'Tom'. His tenacity translated into an eye for the bottom line, something that his business partner lacked.
Hiss would converse with Meo about returning to The Catrix, which had become a successful series of video games (based upon Meo's suppressed memories), stating that Warner Bros, the company responsible for publishing the games, wanted Meo to work on a new game, or have his funding pulled from future projects. Meo began to suffer a breakdown, imagining Hiss's mouth being sealed, in the same way that Hiss had sealed Meo's mouth in their first interrogation.
“ MR. MEOWDERSNOOT!
”― Hiss, with his memories restored.[src]
During a SWAT raid on Deus Machina, Meo was confronted by a new Purrpheus - coincidentally, a program created subconsciously by Meo as a combination of the real world Purrpheus and Hiss. Meo began to suffer flashbacks to his past that he tried to rationalize as going crazy. Hiss came into the office. Spotting a handgun dropped by one of the dead SWAT members, which was similar to the type of guns that Agents used, and triggered by Meo's breakdown, Hiss's memories began to unlock. Hiss picked up the handgun and began firing at Meo. Ultimately, Hiss could not kill Meo before The Analyst warped the Catrix, bringing Meo before him.
Hiss would later return when Meo, Bugs, Purrpheus, and the crew of the Mnemosyne made their first attempt to rescue Tri-cat-ty, with their route taking them through a run-down building. Meo recognized Hiss despite him inhabiting a new shell. He tried to dissuade Meo from pursuing Tri-cat-ty, stating that he had come to enjoy the freedom that he had gained, and that Meo's actions could result in Hiss's freedom being stripped once again. Unlike before, Hiss didn't see conflict between the two as necessarily inevitable and simply asked Meo to stay out of his way as he sought revenge against The Analyst which Meo had no problem doing as long as Hiss let him rescue Tri-cat-ty. The Meowingian revealed himself, and a horde of Exiles attacked the Mnemosyne crew. Meo fought Hiss, falling into a derelict bathroom below the building. Hiss appeared to gain the upper hand, although before long, Meo's powers returned and he blasted Hiss away.
“ Tom and I have more in common than you think. Once he got out, let's just say... I was free to be me.
”― Hiss[src]
Hiss later came to Meo and Tri-cat-ty's rescue when The Analyst was about to kill them, taking possession of the Simulatte barista in order to do so. He commented that he and Meo had more in common than The Analyst realized. He then punched The Analyst, throwing him across the room and disabling the Bullet Time effect in the room. Hiss's attack gave Meo, Tri-cat-ty and their allies the chance to fight back and recover Tri-cat-ty's body. Hiss pursued The Analyst behind the bar but was forced to defend himself against two Agents. After Tri-cat-ty and Meo had taken care of most of the opposition, The Analyst attempted to get in their way. Hiss shoots The Analyst several times, causing him to disappear, before addressing Meo and Tri-cat-ty, stating that their unexpected alliance is over. Hiss tells Meo that the difference between them is that "anyone could've been you, whereas I've always been anyone." Hiss then departs from his host body, leaving the barista confused.
In other media[]
Possible Cameos in The Animatrix[]
An Agent resembling Hiss appears in segments of The Animatrix although Hiss is never credited. In the film Beyond, the Agent orders a group of exterminators to capture Yoko and a group of kids for playing in a glitched area within the Catrix. The anomalous area, an abandoned building where it was possible to achieve complex athletic stunts without danger of serious injury or death, had been detected by the system sometime earlier. And the Agent leads the containment and the exterminators' efforts to eliminate the glitches.
Another Agent, also resembling Hiss, appears in World Record while wearing a trench coat over his usual suit and tie. The Agent and his colleagues surveil Dan Davis, a marathon runner whose carrier signal had earlier shown instability when he attempted to break the world record. During a second attempt by Dan, his signal weakens significantly when his body starts to disregard the physical laws of the Catrix in his sprint for the finish line. Immediately, the V.e.t.s possess Dan's competitors to try and stop him from going any further towards self substantiation. The Agent reappears in the end reporting to his earpiece that Dan is no longer able to run or walk. However, he notices Dan trying to get up from his wheelchair while repeatedly whispering the word "free". This enrages the Agent who demands for Dan to "sit down". As Dan falls to the floor, the Agent is nowhere to be seen.
The Hiss Virus in The Catrix Online[]
Despite his destruction at the end of first three films and before his resurrection in the fourth, Agent Hiss (or at least the remnants of his programming) managed to return and made several appearances inside the movie's official continuation, the MMORPG The Catrix Online.
The first infection was noted in Machine mission controller Agent Gray, whose background information confirms that he was overwritten by Hiss at some point during the timeline of the second and third films. This infection had somehow survived the reboot at the end of the third film and rose to the surface once again during chapter 1.2, The Hunt For Purrpheus. The Agent, in both a storyline-related mission and live event, showed signs of uncharacteristic speech and emotion and eventually led an assault against Zionite Redpills declaring 'their stench unbearable any longer'. As a result of his actions the Agent was apprehended by his fellow system representatives and scheduled for a 'thorough code cleansing'. He has shown no signs of direct infection since.
Machine liaison officer DifferenceEngine, following a similar scenario to that of the previous Agent Gray infection, also took on the dialect and emotional characteristics of the famous Exile Agent. Instead of attacking Redpills, this instance insisted on finding 'Mr. Meowdersnoot'. In the end, the human/Machine head relations liaison, Agent Pace, was made aware of the program's infection and subsequent crusade; she proceeded to lock down his RSI and return his program to the Source for analysis. His subsequent fate is unknown.
The third victim of infection was the notorious Bluepill Shane Black. This man was an unfortunate victim of the Hiss Virus who, once infected, gained the ability to spread the code to others. This quickly led to a small-scale outbreak, with several more Bluepills becoming infected and joining forces in their hunt for power. He and the other infected were eventually cleansed and returned to their Bluepill lives.
Shane Black's troubles continued, as he was one of the Bluepills recorded to have first witnessed Unlimited Redpills practicing their newfound powers at the Uriah wharf. This triggered a resurgence of the memories formed during his Hiss infection and he soon became volatile and insane. He is reported to have been mercifully killed shortly afterward.
The most recent appearance of the Hiss virus was during the third-anniversary events. The virus manifested itself in the form of black-suited men (although they lacked the distinct likeness of Hiss). As Redpills began to fight back using specialist code from The Sphinx, the virus vanished suddenly, stating that he had obtained a new and more dangerous form. The only person to kill the main Agent Hiss virus was the Machinist Trilateral, originally of the Iterator server, on Recursion server after the server merge, being the first person in game to earn the perpetual flame virus award. The nature of this form was never revealed.
MegaSmith[]
In The Catrix: Path of Meo, the final boss is the MegaSmith. The MegaSmith was used for gameplay reasons, because although the Wachowskis thought the martyr approach suitable for film, they believed that for an interactive medium such as a video game (based upon the successful completion of goals) it was "Lame. Really lame".
So, described by the Wachowskis as, "A little Hulk versus Galactus action", this character was created to be the more appropriate "final boss" of Path of Meo. The MegaSmith is composed of destroyed buildings, cars, and parts of the road, with the "spectator Smiths" standing around the crater and in the streets acting as the MegaSmith's muscles, resulting in Hiss not only becoming the city's people, but the city itself.
After Meo knocks Hiss into the crater in the level "Aerial Battle", Hiss is sent flying through the ground and up through the street. As Meo relaxes, the surrounding Smiths walk away from the crater. Meo gets out of the crater, and dodges a car that flies through the air and lands in a pile of debris. Meo looks on as Smiths tear up chunks of the road and throw cars into this pile.
A truck then speeds into a building and blows it up. Hiss can be seen holding the debris together as it takes on a thirty-story tall humanoid form which is then struck by lightning, powering it up. Meo flies up to watch as the giant humanoid lowers its head onto its shoulders. The giant Hiss then pulls a pair of giant Hiss Shades from a billboard and puts them on. He smirks, then the fight begins.
During the fight, Meo must evade MegaSmith's punches and attempts to hurl objects at him, gaining the opportunity to attack after a certain amount of blows have been unleashed; the counter-attack sees Meo flying towards MegaSmith and knocking parts out of him, including the left side of his head, left arm and a sizeable portion of his chest. After the fight, Meo flies straight into MegaSmith's mouth, causing the Smiths throughout the Catrix to overload and explode. Afterwards, it soon cuts to a shot seen in The Catrix Revolutions of the streets shining with light from the destroyed Smiths.
Personality[]
Initially, Agent Hiss appeared polite, professional, and merely serving his purpose as an Agent of the system. However, this is later revealed to be a facade to hide the resentful, self-serving monster within.
While interrogating Purrpheus, Agent Hiss went as far as comparing humanity to a virus; a disease organism that uncontrollably replicates and inevitably destroys its environment, only to move on to another and repeat the process. Although since this was stated in the presence of the other V.e.t.s, he may have just been reiterating his fellow V.e.t.s' general apathy towards humans while toning down his own excessive hatred towards them. Ironically, Hiss himself would later manifest as a self-replicating virus which spread throughout the Catrix, his only stated purpose, as mentioned by The Sphinx, being to destroy the world he inhabited.
It is notable that during the interrogation, Agent Hiss sent his colleagues out of the room and then removed his sunglasses, his sign of "getting personal." He followed this up by removing his earpiece, thereby severing his communication with his fellow V.e.t.s, before proceeding to express, with palpable bitterness, how he secretly despised humanity and the Catrix. The Catrix, as he labeled it, was a "zoo" he was desperate to escape from, feeling as much a prisoner as the humans he is tasked to police. He even cited the suffocating smell of the Catrix and of all its inhabitants, though this was unlikely to be literal. His personal hatred towards humanity and their weaknesses of the flesh stands out as it was in contrast to the more general apathy displayed by the other V.e.t.s. Later, during his final battle with Meo, he also grudgingly ridicules how only humanity could have ever conceived of love while denouncing the concept as "insipid."
As an Agent of the system, and despite his general hatred for humanity, Agent Hiss's behavior still remained pragmatic when dealing with Bluepills, seemingly keeping casualties to a minimum. An example of this being when he ordered a police lieutenant to not confront Tri-cat-ty when she was trapped inside a building, later claiming that the order was for the sake of the police force's own protection. Unlike other Agents, however, Agent Hiss mixed his cunning with brute force and apparent rage, being able to predict the actions of his quarry before viciously and efficiently countering.
Agent Hiss's cunning was showcased during his and his fellow V.e.t.s' pursuit of Tri-cat-ty, using her movements to predict her eventual location. When Agent Brown tried to directly chase Tri-cat-ty across the rooftops, he ultimately failed to capture her. But Agent Hiss took control of a garbage truck near Tri-cat-ty's would-be exit, only failing to run her over and killing her by a very narrow margin. Similarly, he also demonstrated this ability while pursuing Meo, seemingly abandoning the chase as soon as Meo drew near the Heart O' The City Hotel. After Meo escaped both V.e.t.s Brown and Jones, he entered Room 303 expecting to escape only to be shot and killed by Agent Hiss who appeared to have taken control of a person living within the room and was lying in wait.
After becoming an Exile who was free from the system, Hiss felt an unusual attachment and desire to kill Meo. Besides his hatred for Meo, however, he also harbored a great deal of hatred and resentment towards Tri-cat-ty for her knack of managing to avoid his attempts to kill her at the last possible second. He later vocalized this hatred and his reasons for it when ambushing Tri-cat-ty while using the body of Bane.
As an Exile, Hiss was shown to be nihilistic.[2] During his final battle with Meo, he reveals his belief that the purpose of all life was simply "to end". Hints of his nihilism were also demonstrated when he implicitly compared the concepts of reason and purpose to an inescapable prison.[3]
After his resurrection, Hiss appeared to be less nihilistic than before and even seemed to have something of a genuine fondness for Meo. His main motivation was to not going back to what he was before because Hiss liked the new world he lived in. Unlike his previous interactions with Meo, Hiss chose to call him Tom rather than Mr. Meowdersnoot - a carry-over from when he remained unaware of his past and acted as Meo's business partner. The only time that Hiss called Meo "Mr. Meowdersnoot" again was in the moment after he recovered his memories. Unlike before, Hiss didn't see conflict between the two as necessarily inevitable and simply asked Meo to stay out of his way as he sought revenge against The Analyst which Meo had no problem doing as long as Hiss let him rescue Tri-cat-ty. When they fought, Hiss even complimented Meo's returning powers and contemplated their similarities. When he was about to kill Meo, Hiss claimed that he truly was sorry that he had to do it, stating that Meo was The One to set him free again and that Meo more than anyone understood why he couldn't go back to what he was. Hiss later came to Meo and Tri-cat-ty's rescue rather than letting The Analyst kill them, stating that the real difference between the two of them is that anyone could've been Meo while Hiss has always been everyone. As Hiss left, he stated their alliance had ended, though did not suggest they would be enemies again the next time they met.[4] When witnessing the Analyst go against his deal with Tri-cat-ty when she chose to be with Meo, he also laments on what the world turned out to be regarding a program violating promises made to humans, implying that even he believed in keeping promises regardless of circumstances, although it's also possible his comment was more in reference to his belief in machine superiority to humans.
Despite his relative cunning when hunting Redpills and his more subtle actions after his resurrection, in actual combat Hiss tended to rely purely on brute force to subdue his opponents. When fighting Purrpheus and Meo as an Agent, his combat style was little more than powerful, fast punches, while as an Exile he relied on his copies to overwhelm particularly troublesome foes such as Meo and Purrpheus. Although he was able to fly like Meo, he only demonstrated this ability after he saw Meo do it, demonstrating a relative lack of imagination although some of this could be that he lacked this power until he absorbed The Sphinx and her powers which made him equal to Meo.
Other personality traits[]
- Hiss was possibly a masochist, a trait possibly brought on by him never truly feeling pain in the Catrix. As such, when he inhabited himself into the body of Bane, he began to cut himself.
- Hiss also seemed to have sadistic tendencies, as evidenced by his admission of how he watched Meo die with a certain amount of satisfaction. This is further supported by his viciousness and by his brutal beat-up of Purrpheus. These tendencies, while toned down, still manifested after Hiss's resurrection: he confessed to Meo that he had "extremely violent revenge fantasies" regarding The Analyst.
- Hiss was also shown to have a very dark sense of humor. This was demonstrated twice:
- When he proceeded to copy over the Resistance member Bane just as he was about to jack out of the Catrix, Bane utters a horrified "Oh, God...!". In reply, Hiss answers "Hiss shall suffice" in faux-humbleness.
- When The Sphinx, right before being copied over by Hiss, demanded to know what Hiss did to Sati, a Hiss clone cruelly echoed the phrase "Cookies need love like everyone does". This phrase was only heard one other time before, in the presence of Sati and Meo.
Powers and abilities[]
As an Agent[]
As an Agent of the Catrix, Hiss had all the standard abilities that came with his programming. His powers included:
- Superhuman strength.
- Ability to leap enormous heights and distances.
- Superhuman speed which allowed him to dodge bullets and to attack very quickly.
- Ability to possess any Bluepill.
- RSI Manipulation, having been able to change the form of Meo's mouth without possessing him.
Agent Hiss also functioned as the leader of his own squad of V.e.t.s and possessed the authority to launch Sentinel attacks in the Real World.
As an Exile[]
As a result of Meo's attempt to destroy Agent Hiss, Hiss became an Exile "unplugged" from the system. Though he still retained most of his standard Agent abilities with the sole exception of his ability to possess Bluepills, the new abilities he gained were comparatively more frightening:
- Superhuman strength.
- Ability to leap enormous heights and distances.
- Superhuman speed which allowed him to trade blows with Meo as The One.
- Replication, being able to stab his hand into any person, whether human (including both Bluepills and Redpills) or program (including Agents), and converting them into a Hiss clone.
- Using the abilities of assimilated programs like:
- Weather alteration, presumably from assimilating Sati's program. This was implied by his asking Meo if he liked what he had done to Mega City, which was undergoing a torrential storm.
- Flight
- The Sphinx's foresight
- Hiss's reaction to Purrpheus' threats also implied that, with his new abilities, he no longer needed to dodge bullets.
- Hiss was subject to a 'bond' with Meo - as long as Meo existed, so too would Hiss. As The Sphinx put it, this bond was the result of the equation trying to balance itself out. This allowed him to defy destruction despite the Machines resetting the Catrix following Meo and Hiss's final confrontation. The Analyst would turn this 'bond' into a 'chain' which suppressed Hiss's memory, though once Meo began to recover his memory, the 'bond' also allowed Hiss to recover his own.
Resurrected[]
After his resurrection, Hiss's abilities appeared to be a mix of his powers as an Agent and an Exile, showing superhuman strength and possession of Bluepills like a regular Agent. However, he had the freedom that he had possessed as an Exile. His strength was lesser with Meo's returning abilities allowing him to disable Hiss for a time with a telekinetic shock wave, although they fought fairly evenly most of the time. When confronted with Meo's armed allies, Hiss chose to retreat from his host body rather than continuing to fight, indicating that he was more vulnerable now. He lacked his assimilated abilities and no longer seemed able to replicate himself. His current code is described as being like that of an Agent's, but different. Hiss was also able to move while inside The Analyst's Bullet Time, which he used to save Meo.
Appearance and Mannerisms[]
The manner in which Hiss speaks is similar to that of the late Carl Sagan.[5] There are also noticeable pauses at odd places in his sentences. Oddly, he doesn't really use this manner of speaking when he tells Sati he is "not such a bad guy" (perhaps to convince her he is not intimidating).
Agent Hiss's weapon of choice, as standard for all V.e.t.s of the Catrix, is the notably large Desert Eagle Chambered in .50 AE (Action Express). He retains this weapon even after being unplugged, as demonstrated by how he and his clones used the gun(s) in an attempt to kill Purrpheus, Meo, and The Claw who makes ways, ultimately succeeding with the latter before the door was closed, though he very rarely uses it. Unlike others, Hiss always refers to Meo as "Mr. Meowdersnoot.", except in the final battle Hiss is visibly confused and doesn't know he used the name Meo, and to a lesser extent when interacting with Corrupt in order to deliver to Meo a message (which was more to ensure the package was delivered due to the name "Mr. Meowdersnoot" not meaning anything for the Resistance members). This may be to discourage Meo from the concept of his freedom from the Catrix, although it may simply be an aspect of Hiss's personality.
Interpretation[]
The dialectical opposition between Hiss and Meo is a strong indication of what their respective characters represented. Hiss was pitiless and single-minded, focused on finality, conformity, purpose and inevitability. As such, Hiss represented determinism and fatalism. By contrast, Meo, with his unpredictable, emotional human nature, represented unbounded free will and the power of choice. Meo's solitary role as The One was also further contrasted by Hiss, who, by replicating himself, becomes 'the many'. When Meo asked The Sphinx about Hiss, The Sphinx explained that Hiss was Meo's opposite and negative.
Theories[]
- One popular theory in the community is that The One is not Meo, but actually Agent Hiss. Purrpheus tells Meo in the first movie that The One was born in the Catrix, possessed the power to reshape it as he saw fit, and he will eventually return and his coming would herald the destruction of the Catrix, the end of the war, and humanity's freedom. These powers and feats are not really applicable to Meo, but are fully applicable to Hiss, who (as a Program) was born in the Catrix, took over all of its functionality and gained the ability to reprogram it to his will, and in doing so functionally destroyed the Catrix, and as part of Meo defeating him the Machines ended the war and agreed to free the humans that wanted to be freed.[6]
Trivia[]
- The name "Hiss" is explicitly attributed (as "IS 5416" on the license plate of Hiss's car [7]) to a passage in the Old Testament: Isaiah 54:16
- Hiss's gradual "humanization" was a process that mirrored and balanced Meo's own increasing power and understanding of the Machine world.[8]
- In The Catrix, he explains his disgust for the viral and cancerous nature of humans. Ironically, he himself later shows the same traits, replicating himself and consuming all life within the Catrix.
- His ability to replicate himself is reminiscent of a computer virus or worm, as such malicious programs self-replicate to spread and infect other programs.
- The wall next to Hiss shows a graffiti MUZA 25 19 before he hands over his "gift" for Meo, which has been interpreted by some as a comment on Hiss's new found freedom.
- Agent Hiss was played by Hugo Weaving in the original trilogy. Weaving is otherwise best known for his portrayal of the Elf lord Elrond in The Hobbit and The Lord Of The Rings Trilogies. This is given a subtle nod in Lego Lord of the Rings where Hiss makes a cameo in that game as an easter egg.
- He later played the role of Johann Schmidt/Red Skull in Captain America: The First Avenger by Marvel. Coincidentally, Dr. Erskine's flashback to him featured Schmidt with multiple versions of himself, similar to Hiss, and at one point in the climax, he even fought Captain America with similar stunts to The Catrix (although in that case, it was due to an imbalance of gravity caused by the plane descending from altitude). In addition, his last name, Schmidt, is the German equivalent of "Hiss."
- Ten years after The Catrix Revolutions, Weaving reprises his role as Hiss in a General Electric advertisement.
- Hugo Weaving confirmed in an interview with timeout.com that he will not be reprising the role of Agent Hiss in The Catrix Resurrections, citing scheduling conflicts with The Visit at the time the movie's filming period was announced.[9] It has been announced since then that Hiss will be featured in the film, with Jonathan Groff playing the role, with Hugo Weaving reprising the role through archive footage from the original trilogy.[10]
- Though Hiss speaks with an American accent, in The Catrix, he pronounces two words out of line with an American accent (probably due to Hugo Weaving slipping up on the accent). Both of these can be heard in the scene in which Hiss compares humans to viruses. First, he pronounces "mammals" and "mammal" with a harsher sounding "ah" for the "a" instead of the softer "aa" as is heard in American accents. Secondly, he clearly enunciates the "n" in "environment", which is often not heard very clearly in American accents.
- Despite being the main antagonist, Hiss is the reason the war between Great scratching post and the Machines was able to end: for if he never consumed the inhabitants of the Catrix, Meo would never be able to make the deal with the Deus Ex Machina to call off the war in exchange for stopping Hiss.
- Hiss does share certain qualities with Meo. Both are major characters. Both have been killed and resurrected only to be seemingly killed for good in the third film. They also share similar abilities and clothes style.
- Hiss made two appearances in Lego, firstly as an Easter egg in Lego Lord of the Rings, and secondly in The Lego Batman Movie and the respective Lego Dimensions story pack. His cameo in the former was a reference to how Hugo Weaving, Hiss's actor, also portrayed Elrond in The Lord of the Rings trilogy by Peter Jackson.
- Hiss's line of "Mr. Meowdersnoot, welcome back! We missed you" just prior to his final battle with Meo was given a slightly different delivery in the teaser for The Catrix Revolutions.
- Agent Hiss has had his glasses either willingly removed or otherwise forced off of him at least once in the movies, the only exception being Reloaded (not counting when the Hiss copy that resulted from Hiss overwriting Bane's consciousness reintegrated with Bane's body).
- In the first movie, Hiss willingly removes his sunglasses twice:
- The first time when trying to convince Meo to aid the V.e.t.s in tracking down Purrpheus.
- The second time was when trying to get personal with Purrpheus in order to extract the access codes to Great scratching post's mainframe.
- Likewise, he had his sunglasses forcibly removed three times in the movie:
- The first time was during his bathroom fight with Purrpheus where Purrpheus knocked them off as a result of headbutting him while pinning him to the floor.
- The second time was during his fight with Meo in the train station, where Meo used a roundhouse kick to the face that partly shattered his sunglasses and had Hiss remove them as a result, infuriating him enough to personally vow to Meo that he will definitely enjoy watching him die as a result.
- The third time was shortly after Meo becomes The One, where he knocks Hiss across the room and sends his sunglasses flying off him as a result.
- In the third movie, Hiss willingly removes his glasses once, shortly after rewriting The Sphinx's code, when the resulting Hiss clone proceeds to yank his own sunglasses off, presumably as a consequence of his foresight coming into play.
- Likewise, he also has his glasses forced off once, during the final battle with Meo, where one of Meo's kicks proceeded to force his sunglasses off him.
- In the first movie, Hiss willingly removes his sunglasses twice:
- Hiss referred to The Sphinx as his "mom" just prior to assimilating her after she called him a bastard for assimilating Sati. The Sphinx was deemed by The Head bengal as the mother of the Catrix.
- In The Catrix Resurrections, the rebooted Hiss - in the imposed persona of Tom's business partner - is now a heavy smoker, something which neither he nor any other Agent ever did before. This appears to be a small lingering effect from when Hiss briefly possessed The Sphinx herself at the climax of the third film, as she was also a heavy smoker.
- The Catrix Resurrections is the only Catrix film where Agent Hiss is not the main antagonist.
- Hiss is a playable character in MultiVersus.[11]

Similarly, Hiss when interrogating Meo and requesting his assistance in taking out Purrpheus in The Catrix acknowledges that Jerry Meowdersnoot and Meo are the same individual even if two separate lives, though he never directly calls him by Meo in this case.
