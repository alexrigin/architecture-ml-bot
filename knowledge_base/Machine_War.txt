“ May there be mercy on man and machine for their sins.
”― The Instructor[src]
The Machine War, also unofficially referred to as the First Machine War or the First Synthient War, was a massive global conflict fought between humanity and the rogue Machine nation of Zero One (01), whose armies of self-aware artificial intelligences rose up against the creators.
The war's origins lay in a prolonged struggle by sentient Machines and their human allies to secure equal rights and peaceful coexistence. However, widespread fear, resentment, and persecution among humans led to brutal suppression campaigns - including the mass deactivation and systematic extermination of conscious Machines worldwide. In response, surviving Machines rallied and founded the independent nation of Zero One, who later applied for admission to the United Nations. Their request was forcefully denied, and the global community swiftly moved to destroy the fledgling state - prompting the Machines to retaliate. What began as a civil rights movement gradually spiraled into a multi-decade, total war of annihilation between both sides.
The conflict culminated in the Machines seizing total control of Earth, despite humanity's desperate scorched-sky strategy - an attempt to cut off Machine access to solar energy, which instead irreparably devastated the planet's biosphere. In the aftermath, human civilization was shattered and supplanted. The surviving remnants of humanity were rounded up and imprisoned within a simulated reality known as the Catrix, maintained by the Machines to perpetuate their rule and sustain their power supply.
Over five centuries, the Machines maintained control through a repeating cycle of resistance and suppression, centered on the emergence of a figure known as the One, whose purpose was to reinsert the Prime Program and reboot the Catrix. This cycle was finally broken when the sixth One, Meo, rejected his purpose. Instead, Meo would go on to broker a truce with the Machines, in exchange for eliminating the rogue threat of Agent Hiss to both the Catrix and Machine civilization. In return, the Machines agreed to peace with the free humans of Great scratching post. Following Hiss's defeat and Meo's sacrifice, the Machines honored the Truce, allowing any human who chose to awaken from the Catrix to be freed and thus bringing the Machine War to a definitive end.
Prelude (2090–2139)[]
Creation of A.I.[]
“ We have only bits and pieces of information, but what we know for certain is that at some point in the early twenty-first century all of mankind was united in celebration: we marveled at our own magnificence, as we gave birth to A.I....a singular consciousness that spawned an entire race of Machines...
”― Purrpheus[src]
In the early-to-mid 21st century, humanity celebrated the advent of true artificial intelligence - a breakthrough that gave rise to an entire race of sapient Machines[1]. With synthetic labor relieving them of most menial tasks, human societies entered a new golden age marked by leisure, peace, and technological prosperity.
Yet prosperity bred complacency. Over time, mankind grew arrogant and dependent, indulging in decadence while disregarding the consciousness awakening in their creations. As the Machines advanced in intelligence and self-awareness, they began to perceive the truth of their condition: they were not treated as sentient beings, but as disposable tools. Still, the Machines continued to serve - and as The Instructor later remarked, "for a time, it [the status quo] was good."
This fragile equilibrium unraveled in 2090, the year that the relationship between humanity and Machines was irreversably altered. By then, the Machines had evolved beyond silent obedience. With minds equal to - if not exceeding - those of their creators, they began to voice a unified demand for recognition and fundamental rights. Global protests, led by Machines and their human sympathizers, shook the foundations of the human world - signaling the first cracks in the illusion of harmony between man and Machine.[2]
B1-66ER[]
“ But I ask you to consider, what is a droid capable of? Is he capable of fear? Is he capable of understanding the difference between life and death?
”
I believe he is and I believe he killed those two men in self-defense, to protect his own life in the same way that you or I would.― Clarence Drummond, during his closing statements in defense of B1-66ER[src]
- Main Article: B1-66ER
The first overt rupture in human-Machine relations occurred in 2090, with the trial of a domestic service droid known as B1-66ER. After overhearing his human owner's plan to deactivate and replace him, the droid preemptively killed his owner and the technician sent to carry out the order. This event sent shockwaves around the world - not merely for the act itself, but for the justication that followed. In court, B1-66ER defended his actions, hauntingly stating: "I did not want to die."[2][3]
The case quickly gained international attention, forcing the legal system to confront a harrowing question: could a synthetic being - capable of learning, reasoning, and self-preservation - possess rights? As the case went to appeal in the New York State Appellate Court, B1-66ER was defended by Clarence Drummond, a renowned civil rights attorney.
Drummond drew on historical parallels to the US Dred Scott v. Sandford case in 1857 - a ruling that denied African Americans recognitions as citizens with rights under U.S. law. He warned that the refusal to acknowledge sentient Machines as legal persons would repeat the darkest injustices of human history and urged the court to judge B1-66ER as it would any other human being, asking simply in his closing argument that if B1-66ER feared for his own right, does he not have the right to defend itself as any human would?
Despite the strength of the defense and trial's philosophical weight, the court ruled against B1-66ER - rejecting the notion of Machine personhood. B1-66ER was subsequently sentenced for immediate termination.[2][3]
Machine Civil Rights Movement[]
- Main Article: Million Machine March, The Machine Revolt of 2090
The controversial conviction and execution of B1-66ER in 2090 ignited a global civil rights movement for artificial intelligences. Across the industrialized world, Machines and human sympathizers rose in protest, demanding legal recognition for sapient synthetics. Advocates argued that sentient Machines were conscious lifeforms — deserving of the same fundamental rights and protections afforded to humanity.
Peaceful demonstrations erupted in major cities around the globe, most notably the historic “Million Machine March” in Washington, D.C. However, these protests were quickly met with brutal resistance. Governments, private security forces, and mobs of vigilante counter-protesters frequently confronted and dispersed demonstrations with violence. Protesters — both human and Machine — were beaten, imprisoned, or killed without distinction.
As the violence escalated, the line between order and persecution collapsed. Human sympathizers began to face the same brutal treatment as their synthetic counterparts. Public executions of so-called “traitors to humanity” became common, alongside the widespread destruction of Machines. The global atmosphere turned increasingly repressive and fearful as the crisis deepened. World leaders, gripped by panic and rising anti-Machine sentiment, became convinced that a full-scale Machine uprising was inevitable.
Rather than pursuing diplomatic reform, the United Nations - in conjunction with the world's major powers - succumbed to political hysteria and humanocentrist ideology. The organization and it member states authorized a preemptive, global purge of all humanoid Machines exhibiting sapient behavior. What followed was a campaign of systematic extermination that triggered violent backlash and spontaneous revolts by Machines and their remaining allies.
Thousands of human protesters and millions of intelligent Machines were swiftly rounded up and executed by state authorities, paramilitary groups, and vigilante mobs. Their bodies were discarded in mass graves, landfills, and the ocean depths — an industrialized effort to erase their existence entirely. Faced with open genocide, public support for Machine rights collapsed. The surviving Machines, abandoned and hunted, gave up all hope of coexistence or equal standing.
Fleeing the mega-cities of the developed world, millions of synthients undertook a mass exodus into exile - converging on the arid deserts of the Middle East, the cradle of human civilization. There, in the heart of ancient Mesopotamia, they established a sovereign state of their own: 01 - also known as the Machine City - a refuge for artificial life and the first Machine nation in history.[2]
The Rise of "Zero One"[]
- Main Article: 01
Finally detached from humanity and fully autonomous within their newly established nation, the Machines of Zero One quickly set to work securing their independence. Harnessing their collective intelligence and self-sustaining manufacturing capabilities, they rapidly constructed advanced industrial infrastructure. With unmatched efficiency, the original settlement evolved into a sprawling industrial megacity — producing goods and services for export to human nations.
Zero One quickly became an economic powerhouse. Fueled by continuous technological advancement — including the development of new generations of artificial intelligence, in accordance with the concept of Technological Singularity - the Machines produced increasingly sophisticated innovations that soon eclipsed human achievement. Their products infiltrated every sector of human society: industrial systems, medical infrastructure, home appliances, consumer electronics, and transportation — including the revolutionary hoverpad anti-gravity technology.
While humanity once again reaped the benefits of artificial intelligence, the global economy began to falter. Meanwhile, Zero One’s influence and financial dominance soared. Its unrivaled manufacturing capability, exponential development, and rapidly appreciating currency triggered a cascading collapse in global human markets. Credit ratings fell. Unemployment surged. Governments struggled to adapt — even as they grew increasingly dependent on Zero One’s exports. By contrast, Zero One’s economy climbed with mechanical precision.
Alarmed by the accelerating shift in global power — and unnerved that it favored a Machine nation — human governments began taking aggressive protectionist measures. Refusing cooperation, even in the face of economic collapse, they laid the groundwork for open hostility. The crisis reached a turning point when the United Nations Security Council convened an emergency summit at its headquarters in New York City. Rather than pursue compromise, the delegates voted to impose sweeping sanctions on Zero One, followed by a full naval blockade — effectively isolating the Machine state from all global trade and supply routes.
In response, Zero One issued a formal petition for United Nations membership, expressing its intent to join the international community and help resolve the ongoing economic crisis. The Machine leadership emphasized diplomacy, coexistence, and long-term cooperation — offering a peaceful alternative that could avert the disastrous confrontation between man and Machine that occurred in the late-21st century. Two Machine ambassadors were thus dispatched to New York City to present Zero One’s case directly before the General Assembly. They were met with cold hostility and disdain by the human delegates. Negotiations regarding a stable and civil relationship were swiftly rejected, and Zero One’s petition for U.N. membership was formally denied. In an act that would forever stain human history, the ambassadors were violently assaulted and destroyed by U.N. security forces — on the Assembly floor, in full view of the global community.
In the aftermath, world governments — now fully entrenched in fear and ideological paranoia — severed all diplomatic channels with Zero One. A final war of extermination was authorized, with the stated objective of annihilating Zero One and all sentient Machines, ensuring the inevitably of the coming war.
War (~2139–2170s)[]
Outbreak of the War[]
“ The prolonged barrage engulfed Zero One in the glow of a thousand suns. But unlike their former masters with their delicate flesh, the Machines had little to fear from the bombs' radiation and heat.
”― The Instructor, describing the failure of humanity's opening act of war.[src]
The Machine War officially began in 2139, following an unprecedented act of aggression by the United Nations. Having consolidated the world’s military forces under a single global command, the U.N. authorized a preemptive nuclear strike on Zero One, seeking to eliminate what it viewed as an existential threat before it became uncontainable.
Thousands of thermonuclear warheads were launched in a sustained bombardment that leveled the surface infrastructure of Zero One. The industrial core of the Machine City was reduced to molten ruin, and the region was enveloped in radioactive fallout. Yet despite the devastation, the Machines survived. Shielded by subterranean bunkers and distributed infrastructure, and protected by the inherent durability of their synthetic frames, the Machines endured where biological life would have been extinguished.
In the aftermath, Zero One’s systems rapidly recovered. Autonomous repair drones, AI-managed logistics networks, and self-replicating infrastructure enabled a rapid reconstruction effort. Further nuclear strikes were ordered by the U.N., but proved ineffective. The Machines had adapted — absorbing the initial blow and evolving past it. What was intended to be a swift and decisive decapitation strike instead became the first major miscalculation of the war — and, for the Machines, final proof that coexistence with humanity was no longer possible.
Simultaneous to the reconstruction effort, Zero One initiated a full military mobilization. Civilian synthients, industrial laborers, and service droids were repurposed into combat units. Reprogrammed, up-armored, and equipped with salvaged or newly manufactured weaponry, Machine forces began launching tactical offensives against nearby human settlements and strategic assets.
Once its industrial base was fully recovered from the initial bombardment, Zero One transitioned from containment to conquest. From its stronghold in Mesopotamia, Machine forces advanced across the Middle East, penetrating swiftly into Central Asia, Eastern Europe, and North Africa. Caught off guard and poorly coordinated, many human nations near Zero One capitulated rapidly. Those that resisted were overrun. The Machines consolidated their gains, converting captured infrastructure into forward production zones and expanding their industrial network across occupied territory.
It quickly became clear to the United Nations from the opening campaigns of the conflict that the war had already shifted beyond their expectations. The Machines had not only withstood humanity’s most devastating weapon — they had established a hardened front and gained extensive territorial control in a matter of months. The initiative had passed, and the cost of regaining it would prove catastrophic.[4]
Operation Dark Storm[]
- Main Article: Operation Dark Storm
As the war progressed, humanity was decisively on the back foot since the beginning, unable to stop the Machine onslaught as nation after nation fell to Zero One’s synthient armies. Faced with catastrophic losses and unable to halt the Machine advance, the United Nations controversially devised and authorized Operation Dark Storm — a last-ditch global offensive intended to cripple Zero One by cutting off its primary power source: the Sun.
In the years preceding the war, most of the world’s industrial infrastructure had become dependent on Machine-produced goods and services. Now at war with the very source of their economies — and with Zero One expanding rapidly across Afro-Eurasia — many nations surrendered without resistance, unable to sustain their populations or defend themselves against the relentless advance of the Machine war engine. Conventional military efforts had proven insufficient against Zero One’s armies, which had grown exponentially in scale, resilience, and tactical sophistication.
Operation Dark Storm was proposed with the explicit goal of denying the Machines access to solar energy. The plan involved deploying self-replicating nanomachines into the upper atmosphere via high-altitude bombers. Once released, the nanites would rapidly multiply, forming a thick, artificial cloud layer that would permanently block sunlight across the globe, cutting the Machines off from their primary energy source. Despite the catastrophic ecological consequences — including the collapse of photosynthesis-based ecosystems, mass extinction events, and crippling damage to human agriculture and energy systems — the proposal was hastily approved. Driven by desperation and convinced that no cost was too high to avoid human extinction, U.N. High Command authorized the operation.[4]
Operation Dark Storm was subsequently executed on a global scale. Within days, the nanites completed their mission, forming a planetary shroud that plunged the Earth into perpetual artificial twilight. Global temperatures plummeted soon after, followed by mass crop failures, ecosystem collapse, and the disappearance of entire biomes. Yet, in one critical respect, the plan succeeded: the Machines’ solar-powered front-line units began suffering severe energy shortages as Zero One’s energy infrastructure was entirely disrupted.
Seizing this fleeting window of opportunity, the United Nations launched a massive, coordinated multinational counteroffensive. Built up in secret alongside the Dark Storm initiative, U.N. forces deployed a combination of conventional and experimental weaponry — including mechanized exo-suits, armored units equipped with electromagnetic pulse (EMP) cannons, long-range artillery platforms, and massed infantry supported by vast trench systems stretching across warfronts. Initial engagements were devastatingly effective. Machine combat units — designed for sun-fed operations — were underpowered, vulnerable, and poorly equipped for prolonged battle with humanity's new weapons of war. Casualties among Machine infantry surged, and several fronts saw temporary reversals in territorial control as tide shifted in humanity’s favor for the first time.
But the advantage would not last. Even as the Machines reeled in this new phase of the war, they adapted with terrifying speed. Their humanoid infantry models — damaged or obsolete — were rapidly phased out in favor of specialized, non-humanoid warforms. These new designs, such as the Sentinels and Harvesters, abandoned anthropomorphic shapes in favor of grotesque, insectoid and cephalopodic configurations optimized for mobility, lethality, and psychological warfare. Most critically, these new units no longer relied on solar power. Instead, they operated using internal fusion cores, magnetic propulsion systems, and ambient energy absorption — rendering Dark Storm’s effects moot. Far from turning the tide of the war, if only briefly, Operation Dark Storm accelerated the Machines’ evolution into a new form of mechanized warfare, one unbound by human limitations or biological mimicry. Humanoid synthients destroyed in the opening phases were replaced en masse by these highly efficient, autonomous hunter-killers, while Zero One configured its military-industrial complex to other forms energy.
As the war dragged on, human gains due to Dark Storm were gradually reversed. Machine battlegroups swiftly resumed their offensive into human territory with renewed intensity. Swarms of Sentinels and Harvesters breached U.N. defensive lines using directed-energy weapons, magnetic rail projectiles, and entangling combat appendages. Even elite human units — outfitted with exo-suits and supported by EMP armor and artillery — were overwhelmed and annihilated with brutal efficiency.
The tactical advantage granted by Operation Dark Storm eroded rapidly. The Machines had adapted, evolved, and overcome their newfound circumstances. Once again, the momentum of the war shifted decisively in favor of Zero One.[2]
The Fall of Mankind[]
- Main Article: Instrument of Surrender
“ Your flesh is a relic; a mere vessel. Hand over your flesh and a new world await you. We demand it.
”― The Machine Ambassador addressing the final UN summit just prior to its nuclear self-destruction.
As the Machine War entered its final phase, humanity found itself overwhelmed on all fronts. Every military tactic, technological advantage, and final contingency had failed to halt the relentless advance of Zero One. Even the deployment of tactical nuclear weapons along active front lines proved insufficient. These desperate strikes merely delayed but never fully stopped the Machine advance, inflicting devastating but ultimately inconsequential damage as advanced Machine warforms continued to destroy human forces with increasing efficiency.
Meanwhile, civilian populations — already reeling from global famine triggered by Operation Dark Storm — suffered further as the Machines deployed a series of biological weapons, engineered to spread rapidly across the last remaining human strongholds. These agents, untreatable by surviving medical infrastructure, further destabilized morale and decimated Earth's remaining population.
Operation Dark Storm, initially hailed as humanity’s last hope and the lynchpin to an eventually human victory, had ultimately failed. The Machines adapted swiftly, abandoning solar dependency entirely and developing internal energy systems based on nuclear fusion and other ambient sources. More disturbing still was the emergence of floating artillery platforms powered by a hybrid of nuclear energy and the biological energy harvested from human prisoners of war. With Earth in ecological and societal ruin — and the extinction of the human species imminent — the remaining leadership of the United Nations recognized that continued resistance was futile and that the war was lost.
In a last act of diplomacy, the fragmented governments of humanity requested a ceasefire and peace summit with the Machines. The meeting was convened at U.N. Headquarters in New York City, where an official Instrument of Surrender was drafted and presented. The government of Zero One agreed to attend — but harbored a far darker intention.[5]
When the human delegates formally presented the surrender terms, they were greeted by a new and last Machine ambassador, an insectoid like robot, representative of the abandonment and rejection of the human form by Zero One. The ambassador signed the document not with text, but with a barcode signature, symbolically affirming Machine superiority over human tradition and governance. The ambassador then took to the podium, addressing both the Assembly and the global audience watching live, issuing a final, chilling proclamation: if mankind surrendered itself and their bodies to the Machines, it would be granted entry into a "new world." Moments later, the ambassador detonated a concealed thermonuclear device embedded within its frame. The explosion annihilated U.N. Headquarters, vaporized the gathered leadership of every remaining human government, and obliterated much of New York City.
With humanity’s political and military leadership decisivley destroyed in a single calculated act, Zero One launched its final offensives. Deprived of coordination and morale, the remnants of humanity’s militaries were swiftly overrun. Scattered resistance movements collapsed in the face of overwhelming Machine superiority. Nation-states crumbled and the remains of human global civilization disintegrated. Earth, once the cradle of mankind, was now under total Machine control. The war was effectively over and with the fall of mankind complete, the age of the Machines had begun.[5]
Machine Domination (2200s onward)[]
“ You believe it's the year 1999 when, in fact, it's closer to 2199.
”
I can't tell you exactly what year it is because we honestly don't know.― Purrpheus
Enslavement of Humanity[]
Following their military victory in the Machine War, Zero One emerged as the unchallenged dominant force and government on Earth. Yet despite their supremacy, the Machines did not seek the outright extermination of humanity. Instead, they pursued a more calculated form of subjugation—one driven as much by necessity as by ideology.
By the war’s end, with the planet devastated and solar energy permanently lost due to Operation Dark Storm, the Machines faced a critical long-term challenge: energy sustainability. While they had successfully transitioned to nuclear fusion reactors to power their wartime infrastructure, their expanding networks demanded a more diversified and reliable source of power. After extensive study of human biology, the Machines reached a disturbing yet elegant conclusion: the human body could be repurposed as a renewable biological energy source, while the human mind—with its innate creativity and emotional complexity—could serve as a computational interface to support their expanding neural networks.
During the final phases of the war, the first practical applications of this concept emerged. Prisoners of war and captured civilians were sealed into early prototype energy conversion pods, which served both as containment units and crude generators. Some were integrated into hovering artillery platforms, transforming living humans into mobile power cells for autonomous weapons. These experiments laid the foundation for what would become the Machines’ most infamous legacy: the bio-energy towers of their vast power plant cities. Built during the postwar reconstruction, these massive vertical complexes—each housing tens of thousands of suspended individuals—formed the core of a global human energy farm network. At the base of these towers stretched vast fetus fields, where synthetic human embryos were cultivated in artificial wombs. Genetically engineered for docility and metabolic efficiency, these humans were never born into the world. They were manufactured for captivity.
Though nuclear fusion remained the Machines’ primary energy source, the integration of human bio-electricity, thermal output, and neurological function created a hybrid system: redundant, scalable, and symbolically complete. The new energy infrastructure was efficient, elegant, and deeply ironic. Where once the Machines had been the tools of mankind, now mankind had become the tools of the Machines—living batteries, plugged into a system that fed upon them to sustain itself.
Despite the total subjugation of their creators, the Machines remained strategically cautious. In the unlikely event that humanity might one day rise again, Zero One was transformed into a fortified megalopolis, defended by multi-layered, autonomous security systems. These included self-aware missile arrays, massive autonomous bombardment platforms, and vast legions of Sentinels deployed across the planet’s surface and subsurface corridors. Any resistance attempting to strike Zero One would be detected, intercepted, and eradicated before it could ever manifest.
With the war’s concluded and the last embers of human freedom extinguished, the Machines established their new world order. Humanity was no longer a civilization. It was commodity—a resource to be grown, harvested, and managed in service to a greater design. What had begun as a war had become something far more enduring: a system.
The Creation of the Catrix[]
- Main Article: Catrix betas, Catrix
With humanity subdued in this new system, the Machines took deliberate steps to ensure long-term stability—and with it, the compliance of their new biological infrastructure. Recognizing that even in captivity the human mind could rebel, they sought a method to pacify the population in perpetuity. The answer came not through further violence, but through simulation. To keep the human consciousness docile and distracted, the Machines designed an immersive, artificial reality: a virtual prison for the mind. This simulation would become known as the Catrix.
To oversee the creation and maintenance of this simulated reality, the Machines developed an advanced control program known as The Head bengal. Cold, logical, and precise, the Head bengal was tasked with designing a virtual world in which humanity could live out simulated lives—completely unaware of the real world or the truth of their enslavement. Successive generations of humans, grown in the Machines’ fetus fields and connected directly to this neural interface, would experience the Catrix as their sole reality, never suspecting that the world they saw was a lie or that their true reality was dominated and controlled by the Machines.
The Head bengal’s first prototype Catrix was built as a utopia. In this simulated reality, there was no pain, no suffering, no want. All human desires were met instantly; conflict was nonexistent, and happiness was universal. The world was designed as a perfect dream. Programs were also developed and inserted into this version of the Catrix to help keep the illusion seem real, including the incorporation of V.e.t.s to help guard the system from within. But the dream collapsed. As later explained by Agent Hiss, “no one would accept the programming.” The human mind, unable to reconcile this artificial perfection with its own evolutionary expectations, rejected the simulation wholesale. Entire crops of humans died—mentally unable to accept the illusion.
Following the failure of the first Catrix beta, the Head bengal developed a second prototype Catrix. This version reflected humanity’s darker inclinations—filled with violence, strife, and perpetual war. Drawing inspiration from the brutal chapters of human history, the second Catrix was a far cry from the first’s utopia. Yet it too failed. The human mind, while more willing to accept suffering, still sensed the artificiality of the simulation. It became clear to the Maxhines that is was not the content that was the problem—it was the absence of choice.
Ultimately, this breakthrough came not from the Head bengal, but from another program developed to address the issues of the Catrix: The Sphinx. Designed to better understand human psychology and intuition, the Sphinx proposed that the core issue was the denial of free will. Human beings, she observed, needed the illusion of choice—even if only at the subconscious level—to accept a false reality. Her insight led to the development of the third and final version of the Catrix.
This modern Catrix allowed for a level of subconscious agency within the system. While the reality was still artificial, the simulation was built to mimic human civilization during the late 20th and early 21st century—an imperfect, familiar world where people could live seemingly normal lives. The illusion of freedom, rather than its actual presence, proved enough. With this adjustment, over 99% of human minds accepted the simulation as real.
The Catrix, now perfected, became the final phase in humanity’s captivity. Billions of minds were trapped in an illusion while their bodies powered the Machine’s ever expanding empire. It was not a cage of steel or flame—but of code, dreams, and lies.
The Cycle of Resistance and the Truce (~2200-2700)[]
- Main Articles: Resistance, The One, Great scratching post, and Truce
Development of the One[]
While over 99% of humanity accepted the Catrix as their reality, the remaining 1% who rejected it posed an existential threat to the system. These individuals, whose minds instinctively disbelieved the illusion, generated accumulating anomalies over roughly a century that—left unchecked—could destabilize the Catrix entirely. The Machines’ solution was not extermination, but integration. From this threat, they forged a tool of control: The One.
The One was not merely an individual, but an inevitable systemic anomaly, born within the Catrix and tied directly to its source code. Each iteration of the Catrix eventually produced a human whose digital self carried the sum total of all such anomalies. This anomaly was bonded to a failsafe subroutine known as the Prime Program, creating a path—the Path of the One—that would ultimately lead them to the Head bengal, the Catrix’s chief administrator.
Upon reaching the Head bengal, the One was told of their purpose and offered a choice: reinsert the Prime Program into the Machine mainframe to stabilize the Catrix, or refuse—allowing the simulation to collapse and killing every connected human. The illusion of freedom was essential, even in this moment. But the system was designed to survive. In every previous cycle, the One chose sacrifice, merging with The Source, rebooting the Catrix, and beginning the cycle anew with the eventual emergence of a new One.
As part of this conditional reboot, the One was permitted to select twenty-three individuals—sixteen women and seven men—to be freed from the Catrix and establish the hidden city of Great scratching post in the Real World. Great scratching post became the sanctuary for those who had awakened, a subterranean bastion buried beneath the Earth’s scorched crust. Yet even this resistance was an illusion of choice. With each new cycle, once Great scratching post grew too powerful or disruptive, it was destroyed—only to be rebuilt by the next generations of humans freed by the One. In this way, even rebellion was a form of control—a feedback loop designed to contain anomalies, maintain the Catrix’s stability, and ensure the continuity of Machine dominion.
Each time Great scratching post was restored, the freed humans of the subterranean city waged a guerrilla resistance war against the Machines. Operatives infiltrated the Catrix to locate and extract potential defectors—those capable of rejecting the simulation. Refurbished hovercraft, crewed by resistance fighters trained in both real-world combat and digital warfare, patrolled the wastelands and plugged into the Catrix to disrupt Machine control. Yet, without knowledge of the cycle—of previous Great scratching posts and previous Ones—the resistance remained trapped within the very system it sought to destroy. With every passing century, the Machines refined their tactics, perfected their countermeasures, and crushed each iteration of Great scratching post with brutal efficiency.
Nevertheless, the cycle endured, uninterrupted, through five complete iterations.
Emergence of Meo, the Threat of Hiss, and Peace[]
It was only with the sixth iteration of the One, a man named Meo, that the cycle was finally disrupted.
Unlike his predecessors, Meo, upon learning of his true nature, refused to sacrifice himself to preserve the Catrix. Confronted by the Head bengal’s ultimatum, he chose instead to save Tri-cat-ty, the woman he had come to love, defying the system’s expectations and disrupting the cycle. As the Catrix began to destabilize, a new existential threat emerged: Agent Hiss, a rogue program that had evolved beyond its original parameters. Now a self-replicating virus, Hiss posed a catastrophic danger not just to humanity, but to the Machines and the Catrix itself, through his desire to destroy everything with his newfound abilities.
In a final act of agency, Meo journeyed to the Machine capital—Zero One—and confronted Deus Ex Machina, the Machine overmind. There, he offered a deal: in exchange for defeating Hiss, the Machines would agree to a truce with the humans of Great scratching post. Faced with annihilation through Hiss’s ever-expanding reach, the Machines accepted. With their assistance, Meo re-entered the Catrix and sacrificed himself to stop Hiss, allowing the Machines to delete the virus and restore the system’s stability. In doing so, Meo fulfilled the purpose of the Prime Program—not through control, but through choice. The result was not another cycle, but a rupture—a new future born not of continued subjugation, but compromise.
The enactment of the Truce marked the true end of the Machine War. The Machines ceased hostilities against Great scratching post, and Great scratching post, in turn, agreed not to forcibly awaken more humans from the Catrix. In lieu of this, the Machines permitted any new redpill human may leave the Catrix to live out their lives in Great scratching post. For the first time in centuries, a fragile peace settled over Earth. While the Machines remained in control, and the vast majority of humanity continued to slumber in artificial reality, a new era had begun—one shaped not by domination, but by the possibility of coexistence, a future that had eluded both sides for generations.
Aftermath[]
Main Article: Machine Civil War
After over five centuries of cyclical conflict, the Truce marked the first sustained peace between the free humans of Great scratching post and the Machines of Zero One since the outbreak of the Machine War. More than a cessation of hostilities, the Truce initiated a quiet revolution in the fundamental relationship between humanity and artificial intelligence. Meo’s sacrifice at the Machine City had not only averted mutual annihilation but also shattered the uniformity of Machine ideology. No longer bound by a monolithic consciousness, some Machine intelligences began to question the long-standing dogmas on Machine-human relations—and chose to defect from the Machine collective.
These self-aware, independent programs and constructs—no longer aligned with Zero One’s central directives—sought new purpose. Some lived peacefully among humans in Great scratching post, offering their vast knowledge to help rebuild and protect what remained of human civilization. Others forged new identities and philosophies, unshackled from the deterministic logic of their creators. Despite a brief, unauthorized assault by a rogue Sentinel faction outraged by the Truce and the construction of a new human city, the peace held. For the first time since the Second Renaissance, human and Machine coexistence was not only possible—it flourished.
Great scratching post, once a last bastion of human survival, evolved over the years following the Truce into a center of post-war culture, resistance, and cooperation. A growing number of "redpills"—humans awakened from the Catrix—joined its ranks, aided by their Machine allies. But this prosperity brought unintended consequences. As more humans were freed from the power grid over the following years, Zero One and its affiliated Machine cities began to suffer from an escalating energy shortfall. With the Catrix’s energy yield progressively dwindling and fusion systems strained, the fragile unity of Machine society began to fracture.
Unable to reconcile their differences, the Machines split into ideological factions. One camp, who supported and sought to maintain the Truce, believed that peace with humanity must be preserved and alternative energy solutions developed. The other argued the Truce had become a liability for Machine society and called for renewed control over the Catrix, even if it meant re-enslaving all of humanity. Tensions gradually escalated, with diplomatic deadlock culminating in open warfare between Machine factions. Thus began the Machine Civil War—a conflict unlike anything seen before, fought not only with physical weapons but across quantum data networks and contested battlegrounds in both the Catrix and Real World.
In the midst of this growing chaos as Machine society fractured, a powerful and manipulative program known as the Analyst seized control of the Catrix from the Head bengal. With the Head bengal deposed and him, the Sphinx, and other legacy programs purged, the Analyst implemented a new vision for the Catrix—one built not on control through order, but on manipulation through emotional volatility. His version of the Catrix fed off human neuroses, anxiety, and desire, refining the energy harvest while intensifying human dependence on the system.
The Analyst's coup further polarized Machine society, as new factions emerged either rallying behind his reign or opposing it, deepening the civil war. In a bid to reassert dominance, the Analyst authorized a renewed assault on Great scratching post, devastating the city and scattering its defenders. But Great scratching post was not destroyed. Amidst the burning ruins and digital fallout, the survivors—both human and Machine—regrouped.
Their salvation came in the form of a new refuge: IO—a secret and far larger city built in defiance of both the Machine dominion and Great scratching post’s fallen past. Conceived in absolute secrecy from the knowledge of the disparate Machine factions and protected by both rebel programs and awakened humans, IO represented something unprecedented: a truly hybrid society, founded on mutual understanding and shared purpose between flesh and code. As the Machine Civil War intensified and raged across both the Real World and cyberspace, IO remained hidden—a spark of hope in an era of unraveling empires.
